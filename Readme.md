# SkinSense Melanoma

Welcome to SkinSense Melanoma Detection App

**Bangkit 2024 Batch 2**

**Product Capstone Project: SkinSense**

## About This Project

Skin cancer remains one of the serious health concerns for people in the modern world due to an increased incidence because of increased UV exposure and delayed detection. The earlier diagnostic processes had a lot of dependency on manual examination and expert judgment, which may lead to human error and cause delay, hindering the possibility of early treatment, especially in remote areas where access to services is minimal. The end result of the project was an AI-enabled intelligent tool for the early and accurate diagnosis of skin cancer.

The app will employ machine learning and computer vision to analyze skin lesions and determine whether they are benign or malignant. The tool will make possible the key features like instant picture analysis by integrating with a smartphone camera and giving on-the-spot feedback to the user on any skin anomaly. The education module of the tool will also be built in for the users, teaching them about solutions and prevention how they can minimize UV exposure and self-inspect their skin for potential changes in health.

Such a tool democratizes early detection by consolidating speed, accuracy, and access to diagnosis. It is specially designed for wide usage in under-resourced communities to guarantee equity in early screening. These efforts are put in place to diagnose proactively with reduced treatment burden, thereby improving patient outcomes for effective screening available to all.
